            <p>To solve the clean-slate Internet problem, we adopt the following management principles:</p>

              <li>Ignore existing users and hope that they realize that ignoring them now will benefit them later.</li>
              <li>
                Start with a true clean-slate. Avoid trying to salvage elements of existing protocols. Virtuous elements

                Address all of the major problems at once. Counterintuitively, this causes primitive solutions to impose
                mutual constraints on each other that forces them to assume their mutually-cooperative form, thereby
                preventing the researcher from constructing a partial set of primitives that turn-out to be incompatible
                with not-yet-developed primitives.
              </li>
              <li>
                Code first, paper later. If the code works, viability of a paper proposal ceases to be a question.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reconsider existing users, and make-sure to accommodate them by integrating the new with the old as
                painlessly as possible.
              </li>
              <li>Incorporate feedback from existing users into specification.</li>
              <li>Let experts finish the final form.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Next, we adopt the following technical principles:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Eliminate the distinction between nodes and routers and servers. Just make everything a node.</li>
              <li>
                Begin with making the protocol stack a user-mode multi-threaded application that is
                architecturally-lateral instead of subordinate, as is done in TCP/IP and most other protocol stacks, to
                other applications that are executed by the operating system.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add a GUI for human configuration and observation. Structure stack as both client and a server itself,
                so that it may be configured and observed by peer stacks.
              </li>
              <li>Structure the stack so that the presence of a GUI does no interfere with, for example, routing.</li>
              <li>
                Combat complexity with rich, object-oriented data structures, but ensure a good balance between
                performance and ease of programming.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep the code portable, but when it comes to (computationally expensive) crytographic operations, be
                fiendishly opportunistic.
              </li>

            <p className={'body-text'}>To solve the addressing problem, we note the following maxim:</p>
            <p className={'body-text'}>
              <i>Language shapes the way we think, and determines what we can think about.</i> - Benjamin Lee Whorf.
            </p>
            <p className={'body-text'}>If we heed this maxim, we might follow with:</p>
            <p className={'body-text'}>
              <i>To solve, correctly, the naming problem, one must, correctly, name the problem.</i>

              are not really names. www.whitehouse.gov does not denote a name. It denotes an address. Thus, what we have
              long been calling domain names are actually addresses. This seemingly trivial nitick is not trivial at
              all.
            </p>
            <p className={'body-text'}>
              But if FQDN&apos;s are actually addresses, and IP address are addresses, then these two types of
              identfiers have the same referencing power, and are paraellel conceptual alternatives.

              Both of these forms are capable of unambiguosly identifying a location. Which form should be employed is
              determined by context: Humans do well with textual addresses because they are easier to remember.
              Computers do well with digital addresses because they are efficient to store and process.

              Once we have recognized textual address as the proper term for an unambiguous identifier within a global
              space, the next question becomes: What do we call the individual components of a textual address? They are
              names. These names are their own first-class primitives. whitehouse is a name.

            <p className={'body-text'}>
              If textual addresses are composed of names, then what are digital addresses composed of? They are composed
              of numbers. These numbers are their own first-class primitives.
