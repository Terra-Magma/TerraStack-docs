                <p>The Internet is a hack.</p>

                <h2>1969</h2>
                The hack started in 1969 with the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPAnet</a>. The US Department of Defense wanted a wide-scale self-healing network that relied on so-called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching">packet-switching</a>, the dominant way in
                which bits of information move throught the Internet today. Over the next 13 years, various researchers including <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf">Vint Cerf</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn">Bob Kahn</a> laid the foundations of what
                would become the dominant protocols of the Internet.


                <h2>1983</h2>
                The year 1983 was a turning-point. At that time, researchers realized that the fuzzines surrounding their creation was starting to disappear. They could rightly say that
                they had created something exceptionally useful for mankind, because, even then, people around the world had grown to depend on their protocol, mainly for email, but also
                for file transfer, with sprinkles of estoeric uses like sending large amounts of data gathered during high-energy physics experiments.

                <h2>1990</h2>

                <p>
                    At some point between 1983 and 1990, it became clear that the Internet would break-out of the insular communities of academia, government, and large corporations. Home
                    users were starting to find ways to connect. While new casual users were welcomed, it was also alarming, as the number of Internet Protocol addresses available to be allocated
                    to comptuers on the Internet was limited to roughly 4.3 billion. But there were already 5+ billion people on planet, and given the likelihood that each person would eventually
                    have at least one device connected to the Internet, there was clearly not enough addresses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researchers who were responsible for the technical architecture of the Internet so far decided to do something about this situation. They decided to fix the Internet Protocol.
                    They labeled the effort IPnG, for <a target="_blank" href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~narten/ipng.html">Internet Protocol Next Generation</a>. But while everyone agreed that IP should be fixed, there was disagreement regarding what part of it to keep,
                    and what part of it to throw away.

                </p><p>
                    Moreover, not-enough-addresses was only one problem with IP. There were others, like no inherent security, which forced every software
                    developer to roll their own security schemes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The researchers agreed that, while they were fixing the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion">IP address space exhaustion problem</a>, they might as well fix these other problems. But again, there was disagreement regarding how much of IP should be changed. A congenial tussle ensued,
                    and two opposing factions formed. One faction might be described as the <strong>get-it-right</strong> faction. The other might be described as the <strong>patch-it-up</strong> faction.

                    The patch-it-up faction cited the "installed base" as their
                    rationale for not wanting to change too much. By this, they meant that there were already too many users using the existing IP to make gross changes, as that would disrupt
                    the Internet. The get-it-right faction insisted that the number of future users would likely dwarf the number of current users, and so a complete redo, despite the disruption, was warranted, following the principle of least amount of aggregate suffering.
                    A brief, congenial tussle ensued between these factions, and the patch-it-up faction, being in the majority, won.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The patched protocol IPnG, would eventually be called IPv6, for <i>Internet Protocol version 6</i>, given that the extant protocol was already at version 4, and version
                    5, which never materialized, was castaway. After the advent of the WWW, it was expected that if IPv6 was not deployed soon, the Internet would implode under
                    its own weight, nominally in 1996.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While deliberation occurred <a target="_blank" href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web/short-history-web">Tim Berners-Lee gave birth to the WWW</a>. The WWW erased all doubt
                    that something needed to be done quickly about the available number of IP addresses.

                    <h2>1996</h2>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Internet did not implode due to lack of IP addreses. Very clever people of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a> produced a rapid sequence of fixes, in real-time,
                    that kept the Internet running mostly smoothly. Their impressive engineering acrobatics continue even unto this day. They are responsible for most of the "good" technology that is employed in the Internet.
                </p>

                <h2>2005</h2>

                <p>
                    But these patches were hacks, and everyone who worked in computer networking knew they were hacks. The ratio of applied intelligence to net result was astounding.
                    So, observers began to wonder if our collective intellectual suffering
                    was self-inflicted, that perhaps the get-it-right people might have been right after all. This doubt, combined with lack of desirable features that never materialized in IPv6, lead
                    to a resurrection of the get-it-right mantra. The term "Clean Slate Internet was born". The get-it-right crowd re-emerged,
                    but unlike before, where there was no signficant funding for rethinking computer networking, there was now significant financial backing from the US federal governement and other US entities to at least try.
                    Research organizations around the world were encouraged to rethink the Internet.

                    A few open-source/commercial overlay type networks arose. While useful, they do not solve the problems of computer networking at a fundamental level, as they require the
                    existence of some underlying protocol to function, and the goal of clean-slate Internet is to repair the underlying protocol.
                </p>

                <h2>2013</h2>
                <p>
                    None of the clean slate efforts resulted in a network protocol stack that could replace TCP/IPv4. But the Internet needed to continue growing, and growing it did,
                    until Internet researchers were forced to prevent, with yet another hack, the Internet from collapsing onto itself because of <a target="_blank" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1380#section-4.3">routing table explosion.</a>
                </p>
                <h2>2023</h2>

                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geni.net/">GENI</a> shut down its operations on August 1, 2023. It has since transitioned to <a target="_blank" href="https://fabric-testbed.net/">FABRIC</a>.

                <h2>2024</h2>

                <p>After working quietly in parallel with fix-the-Internet efforts, Terra Magma released Terra Stack on 2024-01-01.</p>

                Those other efforts have come in essentially in five flavors:
                <ol>
                    <li>Patch-up the existing protocol stack, making minimal structural changes with the goal of avoiding disruption.</li>
                    <li>Create overlay software that is not a true global-scale protocol stack, but something that requires the existence of IPv4 or IPv6 underneath.</li>
                    <li>Create a framework that might ultimately lead to a clean-slate stack, but only if someone makes its primitives sufficiently specific.</li>
                    <li>Provide a "global environment" such that, <i>if</i> someone were to create a clean-slate protocol stack, that environment would be used to test that clean-slate stack.</li>
                    <li>Provide a forum that facilitates discussion of the social and political aspect of Internet operation.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Terra Stack is none of these. Terra Stack is a true clean-slate Internet protocol stack:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Terra Stack is not a tweak of TCP, UDP, or IP. It is a redo of TCP/UDP/IP. It also redoes several ancillary protocols such as (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol">BGP</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_gateway_protocol">IGP</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol">ICMP</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Terra Stack is not an overlay module that cannot operate without TCP/IPv4 or TCP/IPv6. It can run over over Ethernet and other <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer">Layer-</a>2 links.</li>
                        <li>Terra Stack is not a software framework whose specificity is left to the imagination of the observer.</li>
                        <li>Terra Stack is not a blueprint that facilitates discussion of social and political implications of Future Internet architectures.</li>
                        <li>Terra Stack is not an environment that facilitates experimentation with clean-slate protocol stacks.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>Terra Stack is functionally equivalent with TCP/IPv4 and TCP/IPv6.</p>

                <h1>Problems</h1>
                Most complex problems in engineering consist of a surprisingly number of smaller sub-problems. Internet architecture is no different. If one had to pick how many sub-problems there are in network protocol stacks, "10" would be a good guess.
                But the sub-problems <i>are</i> complex, so we illustrate them by way of fictional actions of fictional internet users.
                <h2>Addressing</h2>Two friends, Alpha and Beta, take different cruise ships from different respective ports of departure to meet at <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau,_Bahamas">Nassau</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas">The Bahamas</a>. While in route, Alpha decides to use the .mp3-playback application on his smartphone to listen to .mp3 files on the mass storage device of Beta’s smartphone with no mediating cloud storage server. The addressing scheme that identifies both smartphones to the .mp3 client application and server applications so that a connection between the devices can be established is the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address">addressing problem</a>.
                <h2>Naming</h2> The .mp3-playback client should have a means of specifying which server application on Beta’s smartphone should be the focus of a connection. Identifying the .mp3-playback server application using an identifier that is easily remembered by humans is one aspect the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network_naming_scheme">naming</a> problem.
                <h2>Numbering</h2>The .mp3-playback client should have a means of specifying which server application on Beta’s smartphone should be the focus of a connection. Identifying the .mp3-playback server application using an identifier that is easily efficiently manipulated by computers is one aspect the numbering problem.
                <h2>Reliability</h2>The free Wi-Fi access point near Beta on Beta’s ship is so popular, it becomes nearly saturated. Packets become lost, corrupted, reordered, replicated, and delayed. Maintaining the semblance of faultless continuity of the data stream is the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(computer_networking)">reliability</a> problem.
                <h2>Prioritization</h2>While Alpha is listening to one of Beta’s .mp3 files, Beta receives an important phone call from her mother. Prioritizing the voice stream over the .mp3-playback stream to minimize the delay that the voice packets experience in Beta’s smartphone, as well as every Internet net node between Beta’s smartphone and her mother’s, if the <strong>prioritization</strong> problem, also known as the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service">quality of service</a> problem.
                <h2>Security</h2>Beta’s mother has the intention of reading back private information over the voice connection, securely. Being able to establish a secure connection between two smartphones, where information can be both veiled and signed, independently, using only the addresses of the respective nodes, is the security problem.
                <h2>Mobility</h2>The saturated Wi-Fi access point becomes too much for Beta to bear. Beta instinctively walks away from the area of congestion, along the deck of the ship, not realizing that, while encircling the ship, she makes and breaks connections with no less than 20 different WiFi access points. There is no detectable interruption of the voice connection, nor of the .mp3 playback, and the paths between Beta’s smartphone, and Alpha’s, remains optimal, as does the path between Beta’s smartphone and her mother’s.  While in motion, Beta’s grandmother joins the conversation by specifying the address of Beta’s smartphone before dialing. Meanwhile, both Alpha’s ship and Beta’s ship cruise close to shore, making and breaking their own wireless connections from ship to shore. No networked device on either ship experiences interruption. Maintaining all active connections seamlessly, while allowing new connections with almost all devices in motion, including, perhaps, those nodes that are responsible for address resolution, simultaneously, with or without security, multicast, or any other feature active, is the mobility problem.
                <h2>Multicast</h2>Suddenly, near Beta’s ship, out of the ocean arises the mythological beast, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken">The Kraken</a>. Beta aims her smartphone to collect real-time video of the beast, and sends a text message to Alpha, who starts watching the video on his smartphone. Others on Alpha’s ship gather around his smartphone, see the beast, then decide that they, too, want to watch, but using their own in-room monitors, simply by specifying a URL-like path to Beta’s video feed. Several hundred passengers on Alpha’s ship watch the beast on Beta’s smartphone, simultaneously, on several hundred different devices, until word gets back to the mainland of USA, then the world, at which point, 1,000,000,000 people suddenly start watching the beast through various Internet-connected devices. Allowing nominally 1,000,000,000 people to receive the stream of a single, relatively feeble source, that might or might not be mobile, without interruption, and without having to rely on a proprietary streaming, cloud, or edge service, is the multicast problem.
                <h2>API</h2>Providing a programmer’s network application API that allows a relatively inexperienced high-school student to be the author of the 1,000,000,000–user video streaming application, with mobility of both source of feed and many of the 1,000,000,000 target nodes to be mobile, simultaneously, perhaps with security, with confidence that the logic of the application is correct, is the programmer’s API problem.

                <h1>Solutions</h1>
                <p>To solve the clean-slate Internet problem, we adopt the following management principles:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Ignore existing users and hope that they realize that ignoring them now will benefit them later.</li>
                    <li>Start with a true clean-slate. Avoid trying to salvage elements of existing protocols. Virtuous elements of existing protocols, such as the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end principle</a>, will reassert themselves automatically in the new protocol on their own merit. </li>
                    <li>Address all of the major problems at once. Counterintuitively, this causes primitive solutions to impose mutual constraints on each other that forces them to assume their mutually-cooperative form, thereby preventing the researcher from constructing a partial set of primitives that turn-out to be incompatible with not-yet-developed primitives.</li>
                    <li>Code first, paper later. If the code works, viability of a paper proposal ceases to be a question.</li>
                    <li>Reconsider existing users, and make-sure to accommodate them by integrating the new with the old as painlessly as possible.</li>
                    <li>Incorporate feedback from existing users into specification.</li>
                    <li>Let experts finish the final form.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Next, we adopt the following technical principles:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Eliminate the distinction between nodes and routers and servers. Just make everything a node.</li>
                    <li>Begin with making the protocol stack a user-mode multi-threaded application that is architecturally-lateral instead of subordinate, as is done in TCP/IP and most other protocol stacks, to other applications that are executed by the operating system.</li>
                    <li>Add a GUI for human configuration and observation. Structure stack as both client and a server itself, so that it may be configured and observed by peer stacks.</li>
                    <li>Structure the stack so that the presence of a GUI does no interfere with, for example, routing.</li>
                    <li>Combat complexity with rich, object-oriented data structures, but ensure a good balance between performance and ease of programming.</li>
                    <li>Keep the code portable, but when it comes to (computationally expensive) crytographic operations, be fiendishly opportunistic.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Addressing</h2>

                <p>To solve the addressing problem, we note the following maxim:</p>

                <p><i>Language shapes the way we think, and determines what we can think about.</i> - Benjamin Lee Whorf.</p>

                <p>If we heed this maxim, we might follow with:</p>

                <p><i>To solve, correctly, the naming problem, one must, correctly, name the problem.</i></p>

                <p>
                    So-called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name">fully qualified domain names (FQDN)</a> are not really names. www.whitehouse.gov does not denote a name. It denotes an address. Thus, what we have long been calling domain names are actually addresses.
                    This seemingly trivial nitick is not trivial at all.
                </p>

                <p>But if FQDN's are actually addresses, and IP address are addresses, then these two types of identfiers have the same referencing power, and are paraellel conceptual alternatives.</p>

                Both of these forms are capable of unambiguosly identifying a location. Which form should be employed is determined by context: Humans do well with textual addresses because they are easier to remember.
                Computers do well with digital addresses because they are efficient to store and process.

                <h2>Naming</h2>
                <p>
                    Once we have recognized textual address as the proper term for an unambiguous identifier within a global space, the next question becomes:
                    What do we call the individual components of a textual address?
                    They are names. These names are their own first-class primitives. whitehouse is a name.
                </p>
                <h2>Numbering</h2>
                <p>If textual addresses are composed of names, then what are digital addresses composed of? They are composed of numbers. These numbers are their own first-class primitives.</p>

                    The <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle-to-everything">Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X)</a> industry, projected to grow to a market size of <a target="_blank" href="https://straitsresearch.com/report/automotive-v2x-market">$36 billion by 2031</a>, depends upon mobility. In fact, essence of V2X is the mobility problem in disguise.
                    If one solves the mobility problem, one solves the core of the V2X problem.

                <h1>Supported Platforms</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Microsoft Windows is supported first (but not because it is the ideal OS for network protocol stacks).</li>
                    <li>Linux will be included. Linux <i>is</i> the ideal OS for network protocol stacks. We expect Linux to run our carrier-grade equipment and mobile nodes.</li>
                    <li>MacOS will be included. We would like to make it easier for Mac nodes to interact with non-Mac nodes.</li>
                    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32">ESP32</a> will be included. No other IoT device has such a high ratio of feature-set/cost.</li>
                    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Arduino</a> will be included in accordance with its memory limitations. We will ~not~ build carrier-grade routers with Arduino, however.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>We will also provide minimal support for unlisted platforms as time/resources allow, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freebsd.org/">BSD</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openindiana.org/">Solaris</a>.</p>
